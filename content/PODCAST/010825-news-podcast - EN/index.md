### Podcast Summary

This episode dives deep into how Donald Trump's global tariff war has unexpectedly become a catalyst for Europe's tech sovereignty. We reveal how Poland, with its "Baltic AI Gigafactory" project and rich reserves of copper and lithium, is transforming from a follower into a rule-maker in the global supply chain reshuffle. However, this rapid economic rise has also ignited a red-hot property market. Why is it that behind Warsaw's soaring property prices lies the anxiety of 30% of its youth who can't afford a home? From international trade wars to the personal dream of owning one, this episode helps you understand how grand narratives impact our real, everyday lives. 🎙️💡
