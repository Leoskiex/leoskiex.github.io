The bell rattled through Miłobór Primary like a loose cog in a grandfather clock, and Fania felt each clang in her ribs. New term, same room—yet everything looked undersized after months on the road. The blackboard was hardly wider than Szwendok’s travelling map; the windows, once majestic, framed only grey gutters and a sliver of spring cloud. She slid into the desk she had abandoned last season, the wooden groove still bearing her initials. Ink-black teeth marks pocked the groove: old proof that quills doubled as anxiety chews.

Today the quill went straight between her teeth. _Don’t bite,_ she scolded herself, yet the feather was already fraying.

The door creaked open and Ms Róża sailed in, green chalk tray balanced like a tea set in her palm. She lifted a stub of chalk to her nose—_sniff_—a ritual as reliable as sunrise, as though scent could grade quality. “Good morning, 3B,” she sang, writing the date in looping cursive. A fine mist of dust rose. “I trust your minds are quicker than my chalk.” That coaxed a polite laugh from most desks; Fania’s throat produced only a squeak.

Behind her Lena dropped into the neighbouring seat, locker key on a ribbon twirling round and round her finger. “Welcome back, world traveller,” she whispered. The ribbon flashed silver, then disappeared behind Lena’s knuckles, twirling faster—the way it always did when gossip simmered. “Everyone’s dying to hear your dragon tales.”

Fania’s stomach folded. Dragons were a continent and a lifetime away.

Ms Róża clapped, palms chalk-flecked. “First task of the term: a spoken report. One minute, tell the class something meaningful you learned during the break.” Groans erupted. Róża raised a brow. “We’ll go alphabetically. That makes—” She consulted the roll. “—Miss Nowak first.”

Ink flavour flooded Fania’s tongue. She hadn’t prepared, because she had imagined slipping into class unseen, letting her adventure stay hers. She wiped her mouth with the back of her sleeve and rose. Thirty pairs of eyes pinned her like butterflies to velvet.

“During the…um…break,” she began, “my sister and I…travelled.” Words stumbled over one another like foals on ice. At the back, Tomek beat a drumroll on locker metal: _clack-clack-clack_. A giggle scuttled across the room. Fania’s ears burned.

Quill between teeth again. She tasted ink, iron, memory. She forced her jaw to unclench. “We travelled with a wind-doctor,” she said more firmly, “searching for…echoes. Real echoes that live in jars.” The quill dropped to her palm; her free hand shaped an invisible lid twisting shut. “I learned that listening is harder than fixing things, but more powerful.”

Silence, but not the respectful kind. A sneeze. A cough. Then Tomek’s smirk: “Did the echoes talk back, Nowak? Or are you hearing voices?”

A ripple of laughter. Lena’s key spun so fast it blurred.

Fania’s pulse hammered. She pictured Szwendok shrugging under a violet sky: _Nie mam pojęcia._ He’d faced mockery plenty. He had carried on. She drew a breath—the four-count she had practised at night—and let the air out slow.

“They do talk,” she said, steady. “Just not the way you expect.” She turned to Ms Róża. “If the class is interested, I can bring the jar for show-and-listen during science.”

Róża tapped chalk against the board, considering. “An interdisciplinary demonstration.” A rare smile curved her lips. “Very well. Wednesday.”

Tomek’s drum riff faltered.

Lunch break tasted of beetroot soup and nerves. Lockers lined the corridor like tin soldiers. Fania balanced her tray on a hip, searched for a safe patch of wall, and nearly collided with Lena.

The key ribbon was still twirling. “You truly brought back a jar?” Lena asked. Curiosity wrestled with disbelief in her voice.

Fania nodded, shifting the strap of her satchel—jar nestled inside, clinking against compass and sand vials. “It’s fragile.”

“What if someone…drops it?” The key paused, hanging like a frozen pendulum.

“Then glass shatters,” Fania admitted. “And my holiday homework becomes confetti.”

Lena’s laugh came out brittle. “People are saying you made it all up to look special.”

A familiar pinch tightened Fania’s chest—the label of _weird girl_ already sticking. “Do you think so?”

Key resumed its orbit. “I…don’t know.” Lena met her gaze. “But I’d like to believe you.”

That was enough. Fania unbuckled the satchel flap just a sliver. Inside, faint gold shimmered where sunlight kissed the jar’s curved cheek. A hush pulsed from within, like distant sea in a shell. Lena inhaled sharply.

“It’s…singing,” she breathed.

“Breathing,” Fania corrected. “Wednesday, you’ll hear the rest.” She snapped the buckle. Down the hallway Tomek’s locker band resumed its tin rhythm, gossip travelling faster than wind.

Lena looped the ribbon around her wrist, stilling the key. “Need, um, moral support on stage?”

“Yes,” Fania confessed.

“Then I’ll sit front row.” A grin. “Sticker posters optional.”

The corridor felt wider, the ceiling higher. Ink still stained her lip, but she no longer cared. Ms Róża breezed past, chalk scent marking her passage. She did not see Fania bite the quill feather—because Fania didn’t. She tucked it behind her ear instead, like a promise she finally intended to keep.

When the bell rang, she was already halfway to class, the echo of her own footsteps steady as a heartbeat that belonged to her and no one else’s rumours.
