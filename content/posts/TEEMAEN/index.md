# A Warm Welcome to Ambassador Liu and Chairman Lee Shih-chin in Wrocław

We extend our heartfelt welcome to Ambassador Liu of the Taipei Representative Office in Poland, accompanied by Mr. Lee Shih-chin, Chairman of the Taiwan Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers’ Association and Honorary Chairman of Inventec Corporation, as you grace Wrocław with your presence. The moment your plane touched down, the instant your footsteps echoed through the streets of this city, it felt as though a conversation—bridging mountains and seas—began to unfold in the quietest of whispers. We are deeply grateful to Ambassador Liu for making this long journey, carrying with you the warmth and aspirations of Taiwan. And to Chairman Lee, we owe special thanks for your tireless efforts, exploring not just Wrocław but other corners of Poland, delving into the promise this land holds for investment. Your visit is a gentle breeze of spring, igniting our hopes that more Taiwanese businesses will turn their eyes to Poland, seeing it as a gateway to the vast expanse of Europe.

This is more than a visit; it’s a meeting of hearts and possibilities. Poland, nestled at the very heart of Europe, stands as a guardian of prosperity, its stability and diligence nurturing a thriving land. Wrocław, a city brimming with creativity, opens its arms to the world with a wealth of technology and talent. And Taiwan? You bring not merely the brilliance of semiconductors and electronics, but a spirit of innovation and pragmatism—a light that shines across the global supply chain. When Taiwan’s ingenuity meets Poland’s markets, it’s as if a river finds its lake, quietly nourishing one another, stirring endless potential. Your vision is nothing short of remarkable: you’ve glimpsed Poland’s promise as a doorway to Europe, a path to 400 million consumers. Such foresight fills us with admiration.

The people of our two nations are bound by an invisible thread, woven from shared values. The resilience of the Polish spirit stands like the oak trees of this land, enduring through storms; the agility of the Taiwanese soul dances like the sea breezes of your island, ever finding a way forward. This kinship lends an unspoken ease to our exchanges, whether in commerce or culture, a trust that runs deep. In an era where global supply chains shift amidst turbulent winds, where geopolitical waves test our foundations, the partnership between Poland and Taiwan feels like an answer gifted by time itself—a future built on the bridge of technology and markets, anchored in friendship and faith. Your presence here today may well be the first stone laid in that bridge.

We dare to hope this visit is but a beginning. Ambassador Liu, with your wisdom and passion, and Chairman Lee, with your insight and resolve, you inspire us to believe that the collaboration between Poland and Taiwan will bloom like flowers in spring, one after another. May you depart with hearts full of harvest, leaving behind seeds of partnership that will grow, in the years to come, into a shared story of prosperity between this land and that island.
